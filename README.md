# Cole Calendar

A modern calendar application with an inverted interface design, built in Go.

## Overview

Cole Calendar reimagines the traditional calendar interface by inverting the standard layout - placing time of day on the X-axis and days of the week on the Y-axis. This creates a more intuitive and visually distinct experience compared to existing calendar applications like Google Calendar.

## Key Features

- **Inverted Layout**: Unique time/day axis orientation for better user experience
- **Calendar Sync**: Pull events from Google Calendar, Proton Calendar, and other external sources
- **Bidirectional Integration**: Push events back to external calendars when supported
- **Web-Based**: Accessible through any modern web browser
- **Go Backend**: Fast, reliable server built with Go

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go web application
- **Frontend**: Web interface served by Go backend
- **Sync Engine**: External calendar integration via CalDAV/REST APIs
- **Database**: Local storage for events and sync state
